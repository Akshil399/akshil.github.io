                            <p align="left">  I completed my bachelor's at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Here, I honed my technical skills through courses such as machine learning, AI, NLP, data structures, database management, web programming, and more. These courses played a pivotal role in shaping me as a computer scientist. Through these courses, I gained a solid foundation in various aspects of computer science, including advanced algorithms, data manipulation techniques, and programming proficiency. This equipped me with the necessary skills to undertake complex projects and solve real-world problems effectively. For my final project, I created a Machine Learning application to detect and assess the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), caused by retinal blood vessel damage due to low insulin. Utilizing image classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) algorithms, I achieved outstanding results: a 97% F1 score for disease detection and a 78% F1 score for severity classification. This underscores the efficacy of deep learning in medical diagnosis and demonstrates my expertise in advanced machine learning techniques."
